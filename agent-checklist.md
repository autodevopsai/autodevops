# DevSecOps Checklist for 

## AWS Cloud-based SaaS Applications

This DevSecOps checklist will help expert DevSecOps engineers ensure that all systems and components within an AWS Cloud-based SaaS application conform to the right standards and secure configurations.

## 1. Infrastructure Security

### 1.1. Network Security

- [ ] Ensure VPCs, subnets, and security groups are configured correctly
- [ ] Limit open ports and protocols to only necessary services
- [ ] Use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to restrict inbound and outbound traffic
- [ ] Enable AWS PrivateLink for private communication between VPCs
- [ ] Enable Amazon GuardDuty for intelligent threat detection

### 1.2. Data Security

- [ ] Use Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora for encrypted and secure data storage
- [ ] Enable encryption at rest for EBS volumes, S3 buckets, and RDS databases
- [ ] Enable encryption in transit using SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Limit data access using IAM policies and roles
- [ ] Regularly backup data and ensure disaster recovery plans are in place

## 2. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- [ ] Implement least-privilege access for IAM users, roles, and groups
- [ ] Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
- [ ] Rotate IAM access keys regularly
- [ ] Use AWS Organizations for centralized management of multiple accounts
- [ ] Monitor and audit IAM activity using AWS CloudTrail

## 3. Application Security

### 3.1. Code Security

- [ ] Implement secure coding practices and guidelines
- [ ] Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to identify code vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools to identify runtime vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement a code review process with security-focused reviewers
- [ ] Utilize precommit hooks to catch security issues early in the development process

### 3.2. Dependency Management

- [ ] Regularly update dependencies and patch known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerable components
- [ ] Implement a dependency management policy
- [ ] Verify the integrity of the supply chain and dependencies

## 4. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- [ ] Integrate security tools into the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Automate security testing using tools such as OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, and Checkmarx
- [ ] Implement a gated deployment process to prevent insecure code from being deployed
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs for security-related events
- [ ] Leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for secure and consistent infrastructure management
- [ ] Implement policy as code to enforce security and compliance requirements

## 5. Container and Kubernetes Security

- [ ] Secure container images using tools like Docker Bench or Clair
- [ ] Use a trusted container registry to store and distribute container images
- [ ] Ensure Kubernetes clusters are configured securely using tools like kube-bench or K-Rail
- [ ] Enable role-based access control (RBAC) within Kubernetes
- [ ] Use network policies to restrict traffic between pods and namespaces

## 6. Cloud Security

- [ ] Implement the principle of least privilege for all cloud resources and services
- [ ] Enable AWS Trusted Advisor to provide real-time guidance on best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper configuration of AWS services, including S3 bucket policies, VPC flow logs, and AWS Config

## 7 Chaos Engineering and Resilience
- [ ] Implement chaos engineering practices to test the resilience of your application and infrastructure
- [ ] Use tools like AWS Fault Injection Simulator or Gremlin to simulate failures and identify weaknesses
- [ ] Develop and test fallback strategies for increased system resiliency
- [ ] Regularly review and update disaster recovery and incident response plans
